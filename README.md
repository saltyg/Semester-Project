# Semester Project: Model-Based Approximate Query Processing 

This is the repository for the semester project "Model-Based Approximate Query Processing" at DIAS at EPFL in the spring semester.
---
This project explores the possibilities to build sample-less model-based AQP methods based on the statistics of the data, where three model-based approach are implemented with kernel density estimation (KDE), and compared with the sampling-based baseline. With a special focus on the weighted-KDE-based method, its properties, advantages and drawbacks are evaluated and analysed on the TPC-H benchmark.
